# **About Me** 

**Hi there! 👋**

I'm **Andrei**, a 1st-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 🎓 Besides diving into the world of front-end development, I'm also super excited about learning game development! 🕹️ There's something magical about creating engaging and user-friendly web interfaces, and now I'm thrilled to explore the realm of game design and development. Let's level up together! 💪

Feel free to explore my repositories and see what I'm working on. Let's connect and learn together!
